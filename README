This script will iterate through folders with images in them, find the date and time they were taken 
based on EXIF data, and save the file to a single folder based on this date and time in this format:

Taken Dec 23, 2010 at 12:34:15 PM
File will be saved as 20101223-123415-0.jpg
*note - the -0 at the end of the file is in case there are multiple images at this time. It'll
increment infinitely.

I'm sure this could be sped up.

Dependencies are the RMagick gem.

Set the folders in the initialize method.
